    "<h2>The Data Analysis Life Cycle:</h2>\n",
    "<p>Discovery – defining the business reason that any analysis is needed. Working with stakeholders to help them ask better questions so that both they and you understand the outcome. Do you have the data you need to answer this question? If not, is there another way to accomplish it with what you do have?</p>\n",
    "<p>Acquisition – Getting the data from various sources and cleaning it. This is the most labor-intensive phase.</p> \n",
    "<p>Exploration- now that the data is cleaned, you can begin to familiarize yourself with it. Making histograms and generally understanding what is included.</p>\n",
    "<p>Data Mining – find patterns and insights. Find correlations and test hypothesis.</p>\n",
    "<p>Predictive Modeling – taking those insights and making them operational so as to predict future outcomes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Project Management:</h2>\n",
    "<p>The project sponsor is the person who champions the vision of the project and has the authority to allocate resources.</p>\n",
    "<p>The project manger is responsible for making sure things get done on time and within budget and removes roadblocks.</p>\n",
    "<p>Scope creep is when new requirements are added to the project that increases the time/resources needed to complete it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Types of Analysis:</h2>\n",
    "<p>Descriptive: Describes the data that is present. Mean, Median, Mode, counting things. How many of each size and color of shirt were sold in the last month? Do we sell more shirts in the summer vs winter?</p>\n",
    "<p>Predictive: Makes predictions about future state of business. Forecasting volumes for example. Based on last summer and winter, what will we sell next year?</p>\n",
    "<p>Prescriptive: Analysis with an end goal of making a recommendation. What colors and sizes of shirts should we sell to maximize profits?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>More Vocabulary and concepts to know:</h2>\n",
    "<p>-Central Limit theorem: There are tons of videos on the internet that can explain better than I can, but the idea is that even if you have a wide spread of a variable, lets say, age in a population, and you take lots of sample groups, the mean age of those sample groups would tend to have a normal distribution. In other words, if you were to take 50 people out of that population and get the mean, then take another 50 random people and get their mean age, and so forth, all of those means would follow the normal distribution (bell curve).</p>\n",
    "<p>-Nearest Neighbors these types of algorithms are used in classification models (taking rows in a dataset and classifying them into groups). Again, the internet is full of likely better explanations but basically think of it as data points on a scatter plot. Based on the distance and similarity of those points, you can group them together.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Time series analysis is just looking at any variable over time</p>\n",
    "<p>-Optimization is figuring out what value a variable should have given certain conditions or restraints. Like the price of lemonade given you only have x amount of lemons, y amount of sugar, z amount of cups all at a certain price.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Look over Bayes Theorem in the text if you have not learned about it before. They give an example of how to figure out if you are given a positive test for a certain medical condition, how likely is it that it is really a true positive vs. a false positive.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Tools to know:</h2>\n",
    "<p>-SQL is the language you can use to get data out of a warehouse.</p>\n",
    "<p>-R is a programing language that is specific to statistics. It also has capabilities to visualize data.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Python is a multipurpose programing language that has libraries that extend its capabilities to do statistical analysis.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Tableau and Power BI are platforms that specialize in visualization. This is where you can make graphs and charts for presentations and data storytelling to executive leaders.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Teams, Slack – these are instant messaging platforms that facilitate in a faster, but less formal, way than email.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Legal/Ethical terms:</h2>\n",
    "<p>-GDPR – European union law regulating their citizens must have informed consent and ability to request or delete their own data that you collect.</p>\n",
    "<p>-Conflict of interest: When the researching organization consciously ignores data that calls their results into question or only presents one side of the results that puts them in a positive light.</p>"
